                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>Green Valley Tree Service was founded in 2009 by Mike Henderson, a third-generation arborist who grew up working alongside his father and grandfather in the tree care industry. What started as a one-truck operation has grown into the valley's most trusted tree service company, but our commitment to quality and safety has never changed.</p>
                    
                    <p>We're a family-owned business that treats every property like our own. Our crew members aren't just employees — they're skilled professionals who take pride in their work and care about the community we serve. Many of our team members have been with us for over a decade.</p>

                    <p>Over the years, we've removed thousands of hazardous trees, helped countless homeowners recover from storm damage, and maintained the health of the beautiful trees that make our valley special. We've earned our reputation through consistent quality, transparent pricing, and treating every customer with respect.</p>
